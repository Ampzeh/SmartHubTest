Welcome to my SmartHubTest repository! This solution demonstrates a full-stack application for managing sales orders, including capturing, updating, deleting, and viewing order information. The application consists of API, UI, Shared and APITests projects, fulfilling the specified requirements for functionality and design.

## Notes
- Please run Update-Database to generate an MS SQL database
- Dropdown values are stored in DB and has been seeded in Init migration
- Ideally the following tables should be included to separately store their data, but for the purpose of this solution they have been ommitted:
    - Customer
    - Product
